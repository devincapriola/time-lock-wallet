# Time Lock Wallet Smart Contract

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Time Lock Wallet smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Overview

The Time Lock Wallet smart contract allows you to lock your cryptocurrency funds for a specified period. This can help prevent impulsive selling during market downturns and encourage long-term holding.

## Features

- Deposit cryptocurrency into the wallet.
- Lock the funds for a specified period.
- Withdraw the funds only after the release time has passed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/devincapriola/time-lock-wallet.git

2. Install dependencies.

3. Modify the smart contract parameters (e.g., release time) as needed.

4. Compile and deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain using tools like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/).

## Usage

1. Deploy the smart contract with the desired release time.

2. Deposit cryptocurrency into the contract using the `deposit` function.

3. Wait until the release time has passed.

4. Use the `withdraw` function to retrieve the locked funds.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that you understand the code and its implications before deploying it to the mainnet.
- Perform thorough testing on testnets before deploying to the mainnet.
- Consider auditing the smart contract code for security vulnerabilities.
